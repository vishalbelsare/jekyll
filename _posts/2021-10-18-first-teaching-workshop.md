Learn how you can use Programming Historian to teach digital humanities skills to your students.

Join Dr. Adam Crymble (UCL) and Anisa Hawes (Programming Historian) for a free Programming Historian Teaching Workshop aimed at history and humanities educators at university level.

This 90-minute online workshop will introduce you to the unique tutorials of the Programming Historian, which publishes novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching. It is now publishing in 4 languages (English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese), and reaching an audience of 2-million readers per year.

### Participants will:
* Learn three different ways to bring practical digital tutorials into your history classroom or university workshop, based on approaches developed at UCLDH, University of Edinburgh, and Universidad de los Andes (Colombia), including remote and in-person delivery options.
* Learn what to do if someone asks you a technical question or encounters a problem that you cannot resolve (or anything else that rattles your confidence).
* Make connections with other scholars looking to bring digital skills into their curriculum for the first time.


### Accessibility Statement:
